<h2 id="communication-rule-lead-with-nonverbal">Communication Rule: Lead with nonverbal.</h2>
<p>Today is the 29th of December 2019. I attended my very first circuit party yesterday on December 28, 2019 in Los Angeles at the age of 38. I attended my very first circuit party yesterday on December 28, 2019 in Los Angeles at the age of 38. Well, Technically, it was the second because the first one was in San Francisco when I met up with a guy from OkCupid, but I left that event way too early because I was not really a fan of club music and scene (even today). Nonetheless, the event in San Francisco did not count. </p>
<p>Anyway, what I observed last night was how raunchy a circuit party could be. Guys were making out (which was similar to bar/club scene), but they sexual acts was pretty obvious, like giving BJ/rimming and even fucking at a very dark corner at the event in the basement. Of course, this is in addition to a club&rsquo;s regular loud music and drugs involved. As far as attendees, a lot of muscled and fit guys—men whom I am usually into. There were also guys who are average and out of shape, but they were not too prevalent. Watching them was already amusing as is. </p>
<p>Another thing I noticed was how much attention one gets if they&rsquo;re shirtless. I was wearing a tight wife beater tank top, which was not bad looking. However, when I went shirtless, people were giving me more compliments. It also became an invitation for others to touch me on my pecs or shoulders, which I did not mind too much at all. </p>
<h2 id="jealousy">Jealousy</h2>
<p>Well, when I was dancing on my own at the basement, one guy approached me. I was taken aback when he asked, &ldquo;Can I give you a kiss?&rdquo; I did not know how to respond. Well, my initial response was to put my &ldquo;guard&rdquo; on, which was reasonable. I also found him somewhat attractive (more than neutral), and if I were to rate my attraction to him, it was probably 6/10. </p>
<p>However, because of my being pretty &ldquo;guarded,&rdquo; I only let him kiss my cheek. He then stepped away, and after a few seconds, I realized I found him attractive and was about to &ldquo;seize the day&rdquo; and invite him to dance. However, at that point, he was already making out with another guy. I was jealous. It felt that I should have been that guy making out with him. And all of these happened in less than a minute from the moment he stepped away. 
I noticed them took their kissing from the dance floor to a corner of the room, where they proceeded to get handsy and even give a blowjob. Suffice to say, I gave my attention to them for the next 30 minutes. It was a curse being approached and not &ldquo;seizing&rdquo; the opportunity soon enough. </p>
<p>After they took a break from their sensual exploration, I got a chance to exchange a few words with Daniel (that guy) and asked him, &ldquo;Where you able to get your kiss?&rdquo; He politely made a convo, introduced himself, and bid me farewell.
My lesson that night were 2 folds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Club Rule:</strong> &ldquo;Seize the day&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Communication Rule:</strong> Lead with nonverbal (eyes, body and face) first and never with words. </li>
</ul>
<p>The night ended at 4AM for me. I went home and had to take a shower because my body had been in contact of too many sweaty guys that night. Overall, it was a fun night. It taught me the importance of leading with nonverbal when communicating and &ldquo;seizing the day&rdquo; right away, which forces one to be in the moment.</p></article>
